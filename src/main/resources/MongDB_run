 # brew services start mongodb-community@6.0 or brew services start mongodb/brew/mongodb-community
 
 List mongo service if started cehck
 # brew services list

 # brew services stop mongodb-community@6.0
 
 To run MongoDB (i.e. the mongod process) manually as a background process, run:

 # mongod --config /usr/local/etc/mongod.conf --fork
 
 
 Connect and Use MongoDB
To begin using MongoDB, connect 
mongosh
 to the running instance. From a new terminal, issue the following:

# mongosh


 
 Run Commands
To run commands in mongosh, you must first connect to a MongoDB deployment.

Switch Databases
To display the database you are using, type db:

db

The operation should return test, which is the default database.

To switch databases, issue the use <db> helper, as in the following example:

# use <database>

To access a different database from the current database without switching your current database context, see the 
db.getSiblingDB() method.

To list the databases available to the user, use the helper show dbs.

Create a New Database and Collection
To create a new database, issue the use <db> command with the database that you would like to create. For example, the following commands create both the database myNewDatabase and the 
collection myCollection using the insertOne() operation:

# use myNewDatabase
# db.myCollection.insertOne( { x: 1 } );
